# Tic-Tac-Toe Project

## Summary

This project is part of the coursework for the "Introduction to Programming in Python" module in the Master's program in Data Analytics at Loyola University. The objective of this project is to implement a simple command-line version of the classic tic-tac-toe game using Python.

## Features

- Command-line interface for easy interaction.
- Display of the current game board after each move.
- Validation of user input to ensure correct moves.
- Detection of game completion and announcement of the winner or a draw.
- Option to replay the game.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x No additional libraries or packages are required.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/tomastravis/tic-tac-toe-project.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd tic_tac_toe`

3. Run the game: `python play.py`

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play. Enter the row and column numbers (1-3) to place your symbol (X) on the board. Keep playing until one player wins or the game ends in a draw. You will be asked if you want to play again.
